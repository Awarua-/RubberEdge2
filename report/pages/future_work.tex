If the experiment was to be repeated, consider using a Macbook Pro touchpad, where access to the \gls{API} for absolute finger position on the touchpad might be easier. This would avoid the use of having to use an iPhone as a touch interface and would eliminate the lag with the existing solution; if this was not possible then consider communicating with the phone over USB. Changing the transition function of the elastic zone for RubberEdge to more closely match the function described in the source paper\cite{Casiez2007RubberEdge}, might help to obtain results that decrease the negative effect on selection time. The study was also limited in the number of participants, increasing this would likely help obtain significant results for selection time.
