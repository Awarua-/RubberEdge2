\section{Conclusion}
RubberEdge enables users to reduce the clutches required to reach pointer targets but maintains the benefits of position control for precise movements. The results show that RubberEdge decreases the number of clutches (14\% - 42\%) for pointer targets at short and long distances. However, the implementation of RubberEdge had a negative effect on selection time; this was primarily due to an inadequate elastic function and lag in the interface. Future iterations of RubberEdge hold promise if the selection time issue can be addressed.
