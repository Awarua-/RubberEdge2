\section{Introduction}
Clutching occurs when a users required more than one finger action to perform a pointer movement. In a classic example of this a user wishes to move the pointer from one end of the screen to the other but runs out of room on their touchpad to complete the movement in a single action, so they are required to reset their finger position a number of times to complete the movement. Because multiple movements are required time is wasted between each clutch invocation, compared to if the pointer movement could be achieved in one motion.
